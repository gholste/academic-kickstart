I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin advised by [Atlas Wang](https://spark.adobe.com/page/CAdrFMJ9QeI2y/). As part of the [**V**isual **I**nformatics @ U**T** **A**ustin (VITA)](https://vita-group.github.io/index.html) group, I use and develop computer vision techniques to solve clinical problems.<br><br>

Previously, I have worked with the [Medical Imaging and Data Integration (MIDI) Lab](https://www.midilab.org/) at Michigan State University under Adam Alessio on multimodal learning for breast cancer prediction and pediatric rib fracture detection.
