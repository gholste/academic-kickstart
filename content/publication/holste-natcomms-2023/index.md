abstract: Deep learning has become a popular tool for computer-aided diagnosis using
medical images, sometimes matching or exceeding the performance of clinicians. However, these models can also reflect and amplify human bias,
potentially resulting inaccurate missed diagnoses. Despite this concern, the
problem of improving model fairness in medical image classification by deep
learning has yet to be fully studied. To address this issue, we propose an
algorithm that leverages the marginal pairwise equal opportunity to reduce
bias in medical image classification. Our evaluations across four tasks using
four independent large-scale cohorts demonstrate that our proposed algorithm not only improves fairness in individual and intersectional subgroups
but also maintains overall performance. Specifically, the relative change in
pairwise fairness difference between our proposed model and the baseline
model was reduced by over 35%, while the relative change in AUC value was
typically within 1%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models,
our proposed approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness
and reliability of image-based computer-aided diagnosis.
