abstract: "**Question**: What is the association between a novel artificial intelligence video-based algorithm for aortic stenosis (AS) and disease progression?<br />
**Findings**: In this multinational cohort study, a video-based biomarker of AS was reproducibly associated with a higher risk of developing new AS, faster progression of AS as shown by Doppler echocardiography, and future aortic valve replacement. The findings were replicated across 2 US-based echocardiography cohorts and in a cross-modality experiment using cardiac magnetic resonance videos in the UK Biobank.<br />
**Meaning**: A unified video-based imaging biomarker may improve the risk stratification of AS development and progression across existing and widely performed modalities."
